# Warnify
A GPS enabled safety companion app that notifies you whenever you are near a dangerous area. 

This app is built to keep you safe outside! 

It will alert you when you are near an area that is flagged with a warning, based on your GPS. 

This can be a dangerous, unfriendly, criminal area or one that may negatively impact your health. 

Registered users can easily create a warning within a set range of their current position. A voting and archiving system keeps the system accurate and updated. 

Become the #1 Safety Officer for your neighbourhood! Earn points for warning others and flagging other warning posts as correct or incorrect.
